# CBAM-Xception
In this study, transfer learning and CBAM-Xception models were used to classify brain tumor MRI images. 

In this paper, the CBAN-Xception model based on transfer learning is used to freeze part of the pre-trained network layer, reduce the model's dependence on large-scale data and accelerate the training process. At the same time, data augmentation technology and CBAM module are introduced to improve the feature extraction and generalization capabilities of the model. Adding a Dropout layer after the CBAM module reduces the risk of overfitting during training.
